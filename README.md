# AI-Driven Research Assistant Powered by Agentic RAG

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo and LlamaIndex. The system is designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models by fetching relevant information from external sources and augmenting queries with contextual data.

### Key Features
- __Retrieve and Augment Data:__ Fetches relevant data and augments queries with context for improved response quality.
- __Generate Accurate Responses:__ Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to generate context-aware answers.
- __Agentic Property:__ Utilizes advanced agents to manage and direct complex queries to the appropriate tools and resources.

### Frameworks and Tools
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- LlamaIndex
- Python
- IPython Notebook

### Highlights
- __Custom RAG Pipeline:__ Integrates retrieval and generation capabilities for accurate responses.
- __Advanced Query Handling:__ Agents manage tools and direct queries efficiently.

### Conclusion
This project showcases the potential of combining retrieval mechanisms with generative AI models to build powerful AI-driven research assistants. For detailed implementation, refer to the provided IPython notebook.
